        <li>We have water, cold-water rinse showers and portable toilets along two miles of the beach.</li>
        <li>The 20 miles of trails pass through some of the best shallow-water fishing areas in Texas. </li>

        <h3>Guadalupe River</h3>
    <ul id="national-parks">
        <li>The park has four miles of river frontage and is located in the middle of a nine-mile stretch of the Guadalupe River. </li>
        <li> Park visitors may enjoy a variety of outdoor activities, including canoeing, fishing, swimming, tubing, picnicking, hiking and camping.</li>
        <li>The park recently opened a 5.3-mile equestrian trail that is also open to mountain biking.</li>
        <li> Opportunities also exist for less vigorous pursuits, such as bird-watching and nature study. </li>
       

        <h3>Enchanted Rock</h3>
    <ul id="national-parks">

        <li>One of the largest, most remote, and least-visited national parks in the lower 48 United States.</li>
        <li>Big Bend's primary attraction is its hiking and backpacking trails.</li>
